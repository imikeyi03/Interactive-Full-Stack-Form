# Interactive-Full-Stack-Form
Unit 3 for Treehouse Tech Degree

## Purpose

This unit helped me to develop my skills using JavaScript for form validation and manipulation. The app keeps the payment form in a default state on page load and changes as the user interacts with the form. This was great for understanding options and selections within forms, as well as event listeners with seperate functions for regex validations.

## Technology Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
